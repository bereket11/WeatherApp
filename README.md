WeatherApp that shows the details of weather for a specific location when a user types the zip code of a city. 
The Application checks the validation of the zip code and internet connection before displaying the weather. And it have a dialog box that guide the user to type a correct zip code. Also, there is Hamburg Menu in the second page of the application. I used MVM Architectural pattern since the application is small it will not be an issue during a test. 

Technologies used for this App are:
Constraint - layout
Espresso - Unit Test
Retrofit2 - RESTFul Web Service


You can run the demo in two ways:
Install the app by building the apk or clone the project to your local file and run it from Android Studio
